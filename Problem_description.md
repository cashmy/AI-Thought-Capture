I have an idea for AI innovation. 

Typically when I am driving to work, my mind begins to creatively come up with some cool ideas (for projects, development, articles, books, etc.) I will then "Walter Mitty" the some of the flow or even specific contextual points or sections. 

By the time I arrive at my desk, I have "forgotten" much of the detail, and even If I remember the concepts, after time spent on other work-related items, I may have even forgotten the concepts. 

I was thinking about getting some kind of voice recorder (NOT a cell phone app as I am typically using it for GPS navigation) that will save my thoughts as MP3 files (or another approprate format) Which I can then upload into an AI ingrated software app that will transcribe the recording, provide a summary and possibly even a classification (e.g. book, article, software app, etc.) 

The classification should then be varified by myself (human collaboration) and a potential task listed created to provide AI tasks to help accomodate a final deliverable.
