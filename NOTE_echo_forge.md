# EchoForge Link — Watcher Relocation

The original AI Thought Capture watcher now lives under the EchoForge program so that all runtime artifacts share a single home.

- **Canonical source:** `projects/echo_forge/watcher/`
- **Docs & quick start:** `projects/echo_forge/watcher/README.md`
- **Configs & MO journal:** `projects/echo_forge/config/` and `projects/echo_forge/mo_journal/`

When working inside `ai-thought-capture`, treat this note as the pointer for ingest/runtime changes. Update EchoForge first, then reference the resulting artifact from here (design notes, status updates, etc.).
