# Documented Actual Steps

  1. (Had an experience!)
  2. Noted the problem
  3. Had a the glimmer of a solution
  4. Described the situation (in detail) with my thoughts of a solution to AI
  5. Generated a concept doc - Read it. Had more ideas!
  6. Generated the initial task list
  7. Created a project folder to hold the output (docs, code, etc.)
  8. _Thought_: If this was being used by someone other than me ... what else would I need?
  9. Updated the task list to include additional thoughts.
  10. Created intial project structure/scaffold -- it WILL change!!
  11. AI Created first component at its suggestion
  12. Requested justification (- it made sense!!!)
  13. Updated the task list to include next steps suggested by AI
  14. Begin to generate docs:
      - Copied my initial request to ai (Problem/solution doc.)
      - First component ("watcher") purpose, use, and justification doc.
      - Created Architectual doc with mermaid flow diagram.
  
  15. Updated the task list to include next steps suggested by AI

  16. Reflective Stop. Re-examined current output. Realized a potential inclusions and possible dovetailing.
    - AI provided some initial context ("liminal cognition", "coginitive load switching", "mental momentum", "contextual nuance")
    - Article ideas: Define the terms, creative "loss" due to fading and contextual nuance loss, 
    - Missed the suggestion for possible marketable branding! (I HAD captured it in the High_Level_Tasks)
    - Do we pause dev? Or can we "simultaneously/parallel process" because of AI? (YES WE CAN!)

    - HUGE! New enhancement: Use the app in cross-context recordings. (MVP 2???)
      -  .e.g. A coach recording observations with a coachee, use personalized context and concept classifications for better integration and task step generation. (do we want/need generic "task" ideas here?)
      - .e.g. A doctor making notes for patient files. Record notes, transcribe, suggest options for follow up based upon doctors standard practice.
      - .e.g. A Dentist tracking procedures, reports current status, suggest options for followup procedures.

    - *Pause/Reflect/Feedback*: - Offer up suggestion to AI for possible paths of inclusion. (current or later) - Generate impact analysis on inclusion or just future planning, etc.

## Todo

  1. Craft High level Module summary doc
  2. Generate Initial High Level Milestone/Artifact summary doc.
  3. Generate Individual Milestone/Artifact detail docs. (Can be done progressively)
  4. Create/Initialize PM tracking (GitHub Projects, Trello, or Jira, etc.)
